Towel is a functional programming library for Rust
(Just a small project I'm playing with as I'm learning haskell)

### ToDoList
* Documentation for data structures
* Examples for combinators


### Implemented Stuff
* Semigroup
* Monoid
* Functor
* Applicative
* Monad
* Bound
* Either
* State
* Reader
* Option Transformer
* Reader Transformer
* Cons Trait
* Combinators

### Documented Stuff
* Semigroup
* Monoid
* Cons
* Bound
* Functor
* Applicative
* Monad

### Undocumented Stuff
Trying to get things of this list
* State
* Option Transformer
* Combinators
* Reader Transformer
* Reader
* Foldable

### Planned Stuff
* Do macro
* Various Transformers and other datatypes
* Either Transformer
* Result Transformer

### Notes
* Unstable features(things I change every other day) have tests in the tests folders
everything else will have doc tests
* Pretty sure rust's iterators provide a good reason to not 
implement Foldable or Traversable not that this project is about
asking whether or not you should
